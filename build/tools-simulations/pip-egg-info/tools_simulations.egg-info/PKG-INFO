        ===========
        
        Towel Stuff provides such and such and so and so. You might find
        it most useful for tasks involving <x> and also <y>. Typical usage
        often looks like this::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from towelstuff import location
            from towelstuff import utils
        
            if utils.has_towel():
                print "Your towel is located:", location.where_is_my_towel()
        
        (Note the double-colon and 4-space indent formatting above.)
        
        Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. *Italics*, **bold**,
        and ``monospace`` look like this.

        =========
        
        Lists look like this:
        
        * First
        
        * Second. Can be multiple lines
          but must be indented properly.
